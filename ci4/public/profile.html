                    Cale Henituse, formerly known as Kim Rok Soo, is the main protagonist of the novel. His soul was moved into the body of Cale Henituse: a minor antagonist from the novel (courtesy of the God of Death). Prior to transmigrating, he had only read the first 5 volumes of the novel. As a result, he did not know the events that would happen after the first 5 volumes.

Kim Rok Soo was 36 years old[2] when he transmigrated in the body of the 18 years old Cale Henituse.[3] Cale Henituse's body was 18 years old when he transmigrated,[3] while his soul as Kim Rok Soo was 36 years old.[2]

                    An F-Class Hunter.

                    And on top of that, an F-class older brother who can’t even begin to catch up to the heels of his amazing S-class little brother.
                    
                    After living a life that fell to pieces and even destroying my little brother’s life, I got another chance by regressing 5 years back. I picked up the resolution:
                    
                    This time, instead of making those mistakes, I will quietly and leisurely live my life.
                    
                    Is what I thought… but the S-Ranks are all kind of… weird and for some reason I can’t seem to be able to get away at all?                </p>
